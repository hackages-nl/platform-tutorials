Here is a bit of jargon that will allow you to better navigate the world of Blockchain and the Kadena ecosystem.

## Web3
Web3, short for "Web 3.0," refers to the third iteration of the internet or the next evolution of the World Wide Web. It represents a vision of a more decentralized and user-centric internet that is built on blockchain and decentralized technologies.

Key features and concepts of Web3 include:

#### 1. Decentralization:
Web3 seeks to reduce reliance on centralized servers and platforms by leveraging blockchain networks. These networks distribute data and computation across a network of nodes, making it more resistant to censorship and single points of failure.

#### 2. User Control:
Web3 puts a strong emphasis on user sovereignty and control over personal data. Users have ownership of their digital assets, identities, and private keys, allowing them to interact directly with dApps without the need for intermediaries.

#### 3. Smart Contracts:
Web3 platforms support smart contracts, self-executing contracts with predetermined conditions written in code. Smart contracts enable automated, trustless interactions between parties, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries.

#### 4. Interoperability:
Web3 envisions a seamless exchange of data and value across different blockchain networks and dApps. Interoperability allows users to access a wide range of services and assets without being limited to a specific blockchain ecosystem.

#### 5. Decentralized Finance (DeFi):
DeFi is a major component of Web3, aiming to recreate traditional financial services such as lending, borrowing, and trading in a decentralized and permissionless manner. DeFi protocols often run on blockchain networks like Ethereum.

#### 6. Web3 Wallets:
Specialized wallets that allow users to manage their cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and interact with dApps. Web3 wallets enable secure and direct connections between users and decentralized applications.

## DApp
DApp stands for Decentralized Application. There are applications that run on a decentralized network, typically a blockchain, and use smart contracts to execute functions without a central controlling authority.

Key features of DApps include:

#### 1. Decentralization:
DApps operate on a distributed network of nodes (computers) rather than relying on a single central server. This decentralized nature ensures that the application remains available and functional even if some nodes go offline or are compromised.

#### 2. Open Source:
DApps are often built using open-source code, meaning that the underlying code is accessible and visible to the public. This transparency allows for audits, community contributions, and increased trust in the application's security.

#### 3. Smart Contracts:
DApps commonly rely on smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with code that automatically enforces the terms of an agreement when certain conditions are met. Smart contracts facilitate automated and trustless interactions between parties.

#### 4. Token Integration: 
Many DApps utilize native tokens (KDA) or cryptocurrencies to facilitate various functions within the application. These tokens can be used for payments, accessing specific features, or participating in the application's governance.

#### 5. Data Ownership:
DApps aim to give users greater control over their data and digital assets. Since data on a blockchain is immutable and owned by the user's private key, users have the ability to manage their information without relying on third-party entities.

#### 6. Trustless Environment:
DApps foster a trustless environment, where users don't need to rely on a central authority to conduct transactions or verify data. The blockchain network and smart contracts handle the verification and execution of operations.

## Pact 
Pact is a programming language created by the Kadena team. Pact is designed to be secure, formal, and easy to audit. It allows for the creation of complex and secure smart contracts with straightforward logic.

## NFTs
NFT stands for "Non-Fungible Token." It is a type of digital asset that represents ownership of a unique item or piece of content on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and interchangeable with each other, NFTs are non-fungible, meaning each token has its own distinct value and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis with another NFT.

Key characteristics of NFTs:

#### 1. Uniqueness:
Each NFT is one-of-a-kind and holds distinct attributes, making it different from all other tokens in the same collection or series.

#### 2. Indivisibility:
NFTs cannot be divided into smaller units like cryptocurrencies. Each token is an indivisible whole.

#### 3. Ownership and Provenance:
NFTs provide verifiable ownership and provenance on the blockchain, ensuring the legitimacy and authenticity of the digital asset.


## DeFi
DeFi stands for (De)centralize (Fi)nance, and it refers to a new financial ecosystem built on blockchain technology, specifically on the principles of decentralization and open access. DeFi aims to recreate traditional financial services and instruments in a decentralized and permissionless manner, removing the need for intermediaries like banks, financial institutions, or central authorities.

Key characteristics of DeFi:

#### 1. Decentralization:
DeFi applications run on blockchain networks, allowing for peer-to-peer interactions without relying on centralized institutions. Smart contracts facilitate automated and trustless transactions, removing the need for intermediaries.

#### 2. Open Access: 
DeFi is open to anyone with an internet connection and a digital wallet. There are no restrictions or barriers to entry, enabling global participation in the financial ecosystem.

#### 3. Interoperability:
DeFi projects often aim for interoperability, meaning they can interact with each other and other blockchain platforms, allowing for composability and innovation.

#### 4. Programmability:
Smart contracts enable programmable and customizable financial services, such as lending, borrowing, trading, and yield farming, which can be executed automatically when certain conditions are met.

## ZK
In the blockchain world, "ZK" stands for "Zero-Knowledge." Zero-Knowledge is a cryptographic concept used to describe a type of proof or protocol where one party (the prover) can demonstrate to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any specific information about the statement itself.

Zero-Knowledge proofs are particularly relevant in blockchain and cryptocurrency contexts, as they allow for privacy-preserving transactions and verifications.
They have applications in various areas, including:

#### 1. Privacy Coins:
Some cryptocurrencies use Zero-Knowledge proofs to ensure transaction privacy. These proofs allow the verification of transactions without revealing the sender, receiver, or transaction amount to the public.

#### 2. Scalability Solutions:
Zero-Knowledge proofs can be used to create compact proofs of large computations, reducing the amount of data that needs to be stored on the blockchain. This can help improve scalability without compromising security.

#### 3. Decentralized Identity:
Zero-Knowledge proofs can be employed in decentralized identity systems to prove certain attributes or properties without disclosing personal information.

#### 4.Secure Smart Contracts:
Zero-Knowledge proofs can be used to verify certain conditions or computations within a smart contract without exposing sensitive data.

#### 5. Auditing and Compliance:
Zero-Knowledge proofs can be utilized to prove compliance with specific regulations or business rules without revealing confidential data.

## Consensus Mechanism (PoW vs PoS)

The consensus mechanisms is the process by which participants in a blockchain network reach an agreement on the state of the ledger.
Common consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).

Both PoW and PoS have their strengths and weaknesses, and different blockchain networks may choose the consensus mechanism that aligns with their specific goals and requirements. Other consensus mechanisms, such as Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), are also used in various blockchain projects, each addressing specific needs in their respective ecosystems.

Kadena uses Proof of Work (PoW) consensus.


## Layer-1 or L-1 
In the context of blockchain and cryptocurrency, "Layer-1" refers to the base or foundational layer of a blockchain protocol. It is the primary layer where the fundamental features and functionalities of the blockchain are implemented. Layer-1 protocols are responsible for handling essential tasks like transaction validation, consensus mechanisms, and block creation.

Here are some key characteristics of Layer-1 blockchains:

#### 1. Consensus Mechanism: 
Layer-1 blockchains define their own consensus mechanisms, which are the rules used to achieve agreement on the state of the blockchain across the network. Common consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).

#### 2. Native Cryptocurrency: 
Layer-1 blockchains have their own native cryptocurrencies, which are used to incentivize miners or validators, pay transaction fees, and secure the network.

#### 3. Security and Immutability: 
The security and immutability of a blockchain network are primarily determined by the design and strength of the Layer-1 protocol. The properties of the consensus mechanism play a significant role in ensuring the integrity of the data on the blockchain.

#### 4. Performance and Scalability:
The performance and scalability of a blockchain are largely influenced by the Layer-1 design. Some Layer-1 blockchains have specific features or techniques to achieve higher transaction throughput and lower latency.

#### 5. Smart Contracts (with Pact): 
While some Layer-1 blockchains support smart contracts natively, others may require a second layer (Layer-2) solution or bridge to enable more complex programmable functionalities.

Examples of Layer-1 blockchains include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA) and Kadena (KDA). These blockchains serve as the foundation for a wide range of applications and use cases, and any improvements or modifications made at the Layer-1 level can have significant implications for the entire blockchain ecosystem.

## Layer-2 or L-2
Layer-2 refers to the second layer of a blockchain ecosystem and is often used to address scalability and efficiency challenges faced by Layer-1 blockchains.
Layer-2 solutions are built on top of existing Layer-1 blockchains and leverage their security while providing additional features and functionalities to enhance the overall performance of the blockchain network.

The main motivations for implementing Layer-2 solutions are to:

#### 1. Improve Scalability:
Blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have limited transaction throughput due to the time required to validate and reach consensus on each transaction. Layer-2 solutions allow a significant increase in transaction processing capacity.

#### 2. Reduce Fees and Latency:
By offloading some transactions from the main blockchain, Layer-2 solutions can lower transaction fees and reduce the time it takes for transactions to be confirmed.

#### 3. Enhance User Experience:
Faster and cheaper transactions lead to a better user experience, making blockchain applications more viable for everyday use.
